# English Premier League Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

## Project Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis of the English Premier League (EPL), focusing on uncovering trends and insights through data visualization and manipulation. The analysis provides a deeper understanding of the league's performance metrics, player statistics, team dynamics, and other critical aspects.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains key information about EPL matches, including:
- **Teams**
- **Players**
- **Match dates**
- **Goals scored**
- **Other performance metrics**

## Objectives
The goal is to explore the dataset and answer questions such as:
- Which team has the highest win percentage?
- How do player statistics influence match outcomes?
- What are the trends in goal scoring over different seasons?

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data types conversion, and ensuring the data is ready for analysis.
- **Data Exploration & Visualization**: 
  - Analyzing team and player performance.
  - Plotting trends in goals, assists, and win/loss records.
  - Identifying standout players and teams over time.
- **Statistical Insights**: Uncovering correlations between variables and their influence on match outcomes.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations (line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, etc.).
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Key Visualizations
- **Win/Loss Trends**: Line plots showing each team's performance across seasons.
- **Player Performance**: Bar charts and scatter plots illustrating player contributions like goals, assists, and appearances.
- **Team Comparisons**: Visual comparisons between top-performing teams and their statistics.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:  
   Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to perform the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```

## Results & Insights
- Top performing teams and players over different EPL seasons.
- Statistical correlations between player contributions and match outcomes.
- Visualized trends in scoring, team formations, and win/loss patterns.
